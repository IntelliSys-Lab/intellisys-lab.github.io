    <h2>To Build the Next-Gen Intelligent Distributed Systems</h2>
    <br />
    <p>I joined the <a href="https://www.lsu.edu/eng/cse/">Computer Science Engineering Division</a> of <a
        href="https://www.lsu.edu/">Louisiana State University (LSU)</a> as an Assistant Professor 2021 spring. I am
      looking for Ph.D. students who are self-motivated and have a strong interest in Machine Learning and Distributed
      Computing Systems. For more information about me and my research, please check my <a
        href="https://intellisys.haow.ca/haowang/">homepage</a>.</p>

    <p>I would like to share with you my story about bridging machine learning and distributed computing systems. If you
      happen to be interested, please drop me an email with your CV and transcript at <a
        href="mailto:haowang@lsu.edu">haowang@lsu.edu</a>. </p>

    <h3><a name="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates"><span
          class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Develop ML for Systems and Build Systems for ML</h3>
    <p>The prosperity of Big Data and Machine Learning (ML) owes to the recent advances in distributed computing
      systems, such as Apache Spark and TensorFlow, which orchestrate numerous servers to process petabytes of data.
    </p>

    <p>With components across datacenters, physical servers, virtual machines, sub-systems, and software stacks,
      distributed computing systems are like the natural ecosystems&mdash;<i>dynamic</i>, <i>complex</i>, and
      <i>random</i>&mdash;a bug flapping its wings might cancel your Uber Eats order.</p>

    <p>In my Ph.D. study, I have been actively applying innovative machine learning techniques to understand the
      dynamic performance of distributed computing systems and build new systems with intelligent scheduling
      algorithms. We want to enable an <i>autopilot</i> in distributed computing systems. </p>

    <p>It is of great FUN to bridge ML and distributed systems! By crafting innovative ML models, you will discover
      unknown behaviors and patterns inside the distributed architecture&mdash;processes, containers, servers, network
      links, and datacenters. Such discoveries eventually inspire you to rethink and redesign the distributed
      computing systems. </p>

    <h3><a name="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates"><span
          class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Our Mission&mdash;Smarter, Faster, and Lighter</h3>

    <p>Yet, innovation just begins in this cross-disciplinary area. </p>

    <p><img src="{{ 'assets/img/isl-logo-dark.svg' | relative_url }} " height="25px" /> IntelliSys Lab is committed
      to building the next-generation intelligent distributed computing systems with the following highlights:</p>

    <p><strong>Smarter learning algorithms</strong> that analyze and understand computation tasks such as CNN models,
      resource provisionings, and the performance of distributed systems. </p>

    <!-- <p><strong>Smarter learning algorithms</strong> that analyze and understand computation tasks such as CNN models and SQL queries, resource provisionings such as GPU utilization and network bandwidth, and the performance of distributed systems. </p> -->


    <p><strong>Faster software and hardware architectures</strong> that fuse intelligent scheduling algorithms such as
      Reinforcement Learning, computing accelerators, and cloud computing. </p>

    <p><strong>Lightweight system design</strong> oriented to mobile devices and IoT sensors. We are pushing forward
      computational intelligence to devices closer to data and users. </p>

    <br />

    <h3><a name="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates"><span
          class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Expectations for You</h3>

    <p>We envision that you would be a good team player fitting into our research context with at least one of the
      following skills: </p>

    <ul>
      <li>A solid understanding of statistics, random process, and optimization theory. Students with no computer science background are also welcomed.</li>
      <li>Familiar with UNIX-like systems and the toolchains of cloud computing. A solid understanding of operating
        systems, computer networks, and at least one programming language (<i>e.g.</i>, Python, C/C++, and Java). </li>
      <li>Knowledge in ML theory on deep learning and reinforcement learning, and experience with frameworks such as
        TensorFlow, PyTorch, and MXNet. </li>
      <li>Understand the internals of distributed computing systems (<i>e.g.</i>, Apache Hadoop and Spark), and
        programming experience with CUDA. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Please note that we can relax the requirements of GRE, TOEFL, and IELTS scores if you match our expectations.

    <h3>
      <a name="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates"><span
          class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why Should You Apply?</h3>

    <p>First of all, this area is exciting and promising that both academia and industry are seeking talents with
      expertise in Machine Learning and Distributed Systems.</p>

    <p>You won't be working alone, and we will closely work together. As your supervisor, I am very willing to share
      with you my experience of seeking both problems and solutions. Ph.D. is hard, but it would be much less suffering
      if you work with the right people in the right place. </p>

    <p>With a very high reputation in research, LSU is the flagship <a
