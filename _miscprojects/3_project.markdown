#### **This is the Internet**

_Intro (Dr. Hao Wang)_

All the computer talk with each other right?

All the computers, no matter what kind of device,

Whether you are like using a phone

Or using a server

Or using a like even a car

When they are connected, they can talk with each other

_Chorus_

This is the internet

If you don’t get it just wait a sec

Give it a minute, it has to finish moving through switches to bring it back

Hit up the DNS

Better just hope there’s no DOS

Search for a name, hope it’s the same per your request

_Verse1_

Send it with TCP, send it with UDP, it don’t even matter

Send it through ISP, you get it with rdt, deliver the packet

Cause if it’s for you or me, or if it’s your company delivery’s faster

Thanks for the internet, without it, it’d take a sec

Internet protocols, domains that will show it all, we can reach out through servers

Don’t need to know it all, or need to be so involved, that we make ourselves nervous

Connect through the router, if they have the power, and start up a session

Now we have the power, information is ours, it’s at our discretion

_Chorus (again)_

_Verse 2_

Packet queing, message movement, internet is showing off

No confusion how we do it, we don’t want no packet loss

CDN’s through VPN’s, we can stream it how we want

P2P with all our friends, we can share it all night long

It’s direct with internet, UPS no disrespect

It’s correct we send the ACK, and if it’s not we send it back

Get the bits and flip it back, just so we can get the check

Get the bits demultiplex, the internet will never lack

_Chorus x2_

_Outro (Dr Hao Wang)_

So when I watch the movie you know the,

They are trying to use the force

How many of you watched this movie?

The star wars right?

When I watched this scene, when I saw this scene,

I thought it’s just like face time right?

But they are using force

We are using you know the internet

This is not new right

Even in the future I don’t think they are new
