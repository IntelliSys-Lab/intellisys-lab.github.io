#### Abstract

Spatial audio is an integral part of immersive entertainment, such as VR/AR, and has seen increasing popularity in cinema and music as well. The most common format of spatial audio is described as first-order Ambisonics (FOA). We seek to extend recent advancements in FOA generative AI models to enable the generation of 3D scenes with dynamic sound sources. Our proposed end-to-end model comes in two variations which vary in their user input and level of precision in sound source localization. In addition to our model, we also present a new dataset of simulated spatial audio-caption pairs. Evaluation of our models demonstrate that they are capable of matching the semantic alignment and audio quality of state of the art models while capturing the desired spatial attributes.
